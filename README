Node.js is a good peice of software, but it lacks a very critical feature: a "development" mode.
In "development" mode, if you modify your application code, it get applied "on the fly",
without the need to restart the application server.

Development for Node.js under Windows, thus, has been a pain.
You had to go and change a line of code,
then go to the Node console window,
then close it by clicking the cross icon,
then go to Explorer and run "start node.js.bat",
and then go to your web browser and finally hit "Refresh"
just to find out if that modified line of code works.

This script fixes that drawback, and is used to run Node.js in "development" mode (works since version 0.5.10 of Node.js).
Thanks to the Node community for helping me to make it work.

Running:
node "c:\work\node-js-development-mode.js" --main-file "code\web\main.js"
or
node "c:\work\node-js-development-mode.js" --main-file "code\web\main.coffee" --coffee-script "c:\work\node\coffee-script\bin\coffee"

You can also specify files, you want to watch (and to ignore), manually (** and * are supported):

node "c:\work\node-js-development-mode.js" --main-file "code\web\main.js" --watch "['*.js', '*.coffee']"

I, personally, run Node.js with this script (I just double click it in Explorer)
"run node.js.bat":

@echo off
rem use utf-8 encoding in console output:
chcp 65001
title node.js
node "c:\work\node-js-development-mode\node-js-development-mode.js" --main-file code/web/main.coffee --coffee-script c:\work\node\coffee-script\bin\coffee --watch "['code/**/*.js', 'code/**/*.coffee']"
pause

Known gotcha: you must run your *.bat file from the root directory of your app - from there on the "dir" command will search for the files.

Make sure you've added path to the "node.exe" file to your system "Path" variable.
(right click "My computer", Properties, blah blah blah, Evironmental variables, find "Path" there, click "Edit", add ";" and path to "node.exe" without trailing slash, "OK")

This script was adapted for Windows by Nikolay Kuchumov (kuchumovn@gmail.com).
The script was initially created by DracoBlue (dracoblue.net) for Linux platform, and is part of the Spludo Framework.
Then I came by it on the internets:
http://dracoblue.net/dev/hot-reload-for-nodejs-servers-on-code-change/173/
and adapted it for my OS.
(It's windoze, cause I don't have money to buy a Mac. If you'd like to assist me in buying a Mac, just email me)
