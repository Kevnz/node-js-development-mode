Node.js is a good peice of software, but it lacks a very critical feature: a "development" mode.
In "development" mode, if you modify your application code, it get applied "on the fly",
without the need to restart the application server.

Development for Node.js under Windows, thus, has been a pain.
You had to go and change a line of code,
then go to the Node console window,
then close it by clicking the cross icon,
then go to Explorer and run "start node.js.bat",
and then go to your web browser and finally hit "Refresh"
just to find out if that modified line of code works.

This script fixes that drawback, and is used to run Node.js in "development" mode.
Thanks to the Node community for helping me to make it work.

Running:
node "c:\work\node-js-development-mode.js" --main-file "code\web\main.js"
or
node "c:\work\node-js-development-mode.js" --main-file "code\web\main.coffee" --coffee-script "c:\work\node\coffee-script\bin\coffee"

You can also specify files, you want to watch, manually:

node "c:\work\node-js-development-mode.js" --main-file "code\web\main.js" --files-to-watch "['*.js', '*.coffee']"

I, personally, run Node.js with this script (I just double click it in Explorer)
"run node.js.bat":

@echo off
title node.js
node "c:\work\node-js-development-mode\node-js-development-mode.js" --main-file code/web/main.coffee --coffee-script c:\work\node\coffee-script\bin\coffee
pause

Make sure you've added path to the "node.exe" file to your system "Path" variable.
(right click "My computer", Properties, blah blah blah, Evironmental variables, find "Path" there, click "Edit", add ";" and path to "node.exe" without trailing slash, "OK")

Known issue: you'll get "Error: write EINVAL", if you try to output to console right after the application starts.
But, if you output to console anything while, say, responding to a request, that's ok and is gonna work.
Just don't output to console while initializing your application.
 
This script was adapted for Windows by Nikolay Kuchumov (kuchumovn@gmail.com).
The script was initially created by DracoBlue (dracoblue.net) for Linux platform, and is part of the Spludo Framework.
Then I came by it on the internets:
http://dracoblue.net/dev/hot-reload-for-nodejs-servers-on-code-change/173/
and adapted it for my OS.
(It's windoze, cause I don't have money to buy a Mac. If you'd like to assist me in buying a Mac, just email me)
